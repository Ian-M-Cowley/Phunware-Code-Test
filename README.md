# Phunware-Code-Test
Ian Cowley's Code Test for Phunware

I am submitting this project with a few assumptions:

- There is basic styling done but additional would be completed with the guidance of an Art Director (AD).<br>
- The placeholder asset for the images would be replaced with a higher quality one given by an AD.<br>
- The data is stored in a singleton controller object for simplicity. If there was a better API or the data was significantly larger, a different method would be chosen.<br>
- The schedule is created with dynamic views. If the schedule items were more intricate or there were significantly more of them, a recycler and adapter would be used.<br>
